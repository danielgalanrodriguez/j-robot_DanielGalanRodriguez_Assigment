# Jayway's Robot Assignment solution

Jayway's Programming assignment solution: Robot programming

## Installation

### Requirements

- In order to run the project you do not need any extra configuration or package manager, just your browser.

- In order to run the project tests you should have installed 'npm' or yarn' as a package manager.

### Usage

To run the app, just open the "index.html" file located inside the project's root folder.

### Test execution

To run the tests, execute the following commands in the project's root folder.

- First, install all dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

- Finally,to run the tests.

```bash
npm test
```

## Programming language used

### Javascript

It was easy to pick a language to develop this assignment. I chose Javascript because it is the simplest language to solve the assignment.

My approach is to keep it as simple as possible with the minimum code and avoiding boilerplate. JS does not require any type of configuration, you can start programming right away with no boilerplate at all. Finally since it is web based it was an obvious solution as well.

### HTML & CSS

Since it is web based I used HTML and CSS to create the skeleton of the page and to apply styles.

## Frameworks used

I do not use any framework for the solution. I though about using React but there aren't many DOM manipulations and all them are simple ones I decided not to use it. Adding React or any other framework would just add more complexity to the project and, in my opinion, does not provided much advantages so I decided that it was not worth it.  

### Jest

In order to test I decided to use a testing framework. It definitely adds complexity and requires you to use a package manager (which I wanted to avoid) but it is way more convenient and makes really easy the testing task. Also it is widely used and it barely needs configuration. Many advantages so it is worth to use.
